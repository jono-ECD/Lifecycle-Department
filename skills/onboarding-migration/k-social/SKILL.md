# K:Social

- ID: `onboarding-migration.k-social`
- Owner: _unassigned_
- Status: draft
- Version: 0.1.0
- Last reviewed: _never_

## Purpose

Klaviyo Social setup and integration into the lifecycle program, so social audiences and owned-channel audiences resolve against the same profile data rather than running as a separate silo.

## Required inputs

- Connected social accounts and ad access
- Audience and segment strategy
- Creative inventory and cadence

If a required input is missing, stop and request it from the account owner rather
than inferring it. Record the gap in the account README.

## Instructions

> **Not yet written.** This skill is scaffolded from the department service
> taxonomy: purpose, inputs, and outputs are settled; the step-by-step procedure
> is not. Do not rely on this skill for delivery until this section is complete
> and status is `approved`.

1. Confirm the account and scope against `accounts/<slug>/README.md`.
2. Load the required account context listed above.
3. _Procedure to be documented._
4. Run the quality checks below.
5. Save the output to the destination named under Output.

## Output

- Connected social channels
- Audience sync between owned and paid
- Cross-channel measurement view

Deliverables are stored under the account, never in this folder. See
`governance/account-isolation.md`.

## Quality checks

_To be defined with the procedure. Until then, department quality standards in
`department/quality-standards.md` apply as the minimum bar._

## Tools and action boundaries

Account data access is not uniform — resolve the account through
`accounts/registry.yml` and confirm a connector exists before promising live data.
See `integrations/mcp/tool-map.md` for verified capabilities.

## Account customization

Account facts belong in `accounts/<slug>/context/`, not in this skill. Create an
account-local skill only when the *procedure* differs, not the inputs. See
`governance/skill-authoring.md`.

## Dependencies

`marketing-analytics-personalization` for the shared profile and event layer.

## Examples and references

_None yet._
